New code for the Wallingford Hockeyclub scoreboard


Multiple RGB matrix LED panels

connected via an Adafruit HAT to a Raspberry pi zeroW

idea is that the pi Zero will act a wireless hot spot and receive MQTT messages to update the board

first working attempt = Scoreboard.py

refectored now I know a bit more about OOP into Scoreboard2.py

Mosquito MQTT broker running on the Pi0
Scoreboard2.py looks for messages and updates the screen when they are received

Webserver, also hosted on teh Pi0 servers a page that creates and sends the MQTT messages - see the MQTT repository

Thanks to Heller's LED package and the various scoreboard makers I have copied off

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

The installers will have set up the programme so they run when the pi is started. For this setup they only need to be started if the home router is not found. So automatic startup needs to be disabled. This is done with the following commands:

sudo systemctl disable hostapd
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq



ensure the following are installed
# git to allow easier updates to the software
# pip to allow install of other python packages

# flask - potential webserver instead of apache

# mosquitto - 
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
# pyton connectivity to mosquitto
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
#update mosquitto.conf to include websockets
# mosquitto client

# make sure we have the lastest raspberry OS

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# install hostapd

sudo apt-get install hostapd

#install dnsmasq

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

The installers will have set up the programme so they run when the pi is started. For this setup they only need to be started if the home router is not found. So automatic startup needs to be disabled. This is done with the following commands:

sudo systemctl disable hostapd
sudo systemctl disable dnsmasq

And follow instructyion on www.raspberryconnect.com for setting up raspberry pi as hotspot if no wifi is found
http://www.raspberryconnect.com/network/item/331-raspberry-pi-auto-wifi-hotspot-switch-direct-connection

sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

Go to the bottom of the file and add the following lines (download here)


#AutoHotspot Config
#stop DNSmasq from using resolv.conf
no-resolv
#Interface to use
interface=wlan0
bind-interfaces
dhcp-range=10.0.0.50,10.0.0.150,12h


Open dhcpcd.conf with the command

sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

at the bottom of the file enter the line

nohook wpa_supplicant

autohotspot service file
Next we have to create a service which will run the autohotspot script when the Raspberry Pi starts up.

create a new file with the command

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/autohotspot.service

Then enter the following text or download here


[Unit]
Description=Automatically generates an internet Hotspot when a valid ssid is not in range
After=multi-user.target
[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autohotspot
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


ensure the following are installed
# git to allow easier updates to the software
# pip to allow install of other python packages

# flask - potential webserver instead of apache

# mosquitto - 
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
# pyton connectivity to mosquitto
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
#update mosquitto.conf to include websockets
# mosquitto client

# to allow access to the RTC on the adafruit hat
sudo apt-get install python-smbus i2c-tools
